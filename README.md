## About the Project

Generically titled "webshop" is my first full scale project for my portfolio, a fullstack application mimicing a real webshop with the intent of utilizing NextJS and React to its full potential with focus on separation of server/client side rendering. This project has been my exercise to further learn the various tooling used by web devs, such as lazy loading using React suspense, internationalization (cross-language support), and proper handling of user data, images, browser storage, auth sessions and more.

## Tech stack

- TypeScript
- React
- NextJs
- Prisma ORM
- PostgreSQL using supabase
- Cloudinary (for storing images)
- Next auth
